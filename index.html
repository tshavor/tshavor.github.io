					<p><more>I served as a technical consultant for the State of Georgia and Fulton/DeKalb County Health Departments for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)  Data to Care Program.  Data to Care programs use laboratory reports received by a health department’s HIV surveillance program as markers of HIV care and analyze them to identify individuals who either never linked to care after diagnosis or who did not continue to receive care. The program then offers individuals on this list for outreach by health departments, providers, or both to assist them with getting into HIV care.

					<br>
					<br>

					My involvement with these health departments involves serving as the primary technical assistance resource related to HIV Surveillance processes, demonstrating analytical techniques to utilize  person-searching software database collections to identify migration trends among HIV-infected clients, and the practical application of similar principles learned from my experiences in projects I developed and managed in while serving as the Epidemiology and Surveillance Director with the State of Tennessee Health Department's HIV/STD Program.</more></p>

These needs involved providing surveillance data and epidemiological technical assistance to the HIV Prevention, STD Prevention, Ryan White, and HOPWA programs.

					Throughout my career, I served as the Primary Product Owner for the implementation of the following large-scale software implementation projects within the HIV/STD Program:

					In my role on the RRT, I analyzed all potential data sources obtained from worker activity reports and laboratory surveillance reports from STD/MIS (and other locally-controlled databases) to determine if program metrics derived from the CDC STD cooperative agreement (CSPS), were being achieved.  Additional data reports that I produced for decision-making purposes included analyses of local syphilis cases, along with epidemiological descriptions of the distribution of diseases among specific sub-populations, open case line listings for the current working month and two months prior, cases with adverse disposition for field investigations, mobile screening activities, and reports identiiying clustering opportunities are initiated where appropriate, and reports describing re-interviews and cluster interviews.</more></p>
